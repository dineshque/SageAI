- **Secondary**: [vulnerability@sageai.com](mailto:vulnerability@sageai.com)

### üìù What to Include

To help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue, please include as much of the following information as possible:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
- **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline
